\usage{
dygraph(data, x, y, y2, sync = FALSE, defaults = TRUE,
  candlestick = is.OHLC(data), trades = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame}

\item{x}{optional character string identifying column in the data for x-axis (TODO: support for vector)
If not supplied, attempt is made to detect it from timeBased data columns or rownames}

\item{y}{optional character string identifying column in the data for y-axis series (TODO: support for vector)}

\item{y2}{(not yet supported) optional character string identifying column in the data for secondary y-axis series (TODO: support for vector)}

\item{sync}{logical default FALSE. Set to TRUE and dygraph will react to highlights and redraws
in other dygraphs on the same page. (TODO: supply vector of chartIds to sync this chart with)}

\item{...}{further options passed to the dygraph options slot. See http://dygraphs.com/options.html}

\item{defaults}{logical. Should some dygraph options defaults be preloaded? Default is TRUE.
Options supplied via ... will still override these defaults.}

\item{candlestick}{logical. Display OHLC data as candlesticks?
Defaults to is.OHLC(data). Effort is made to detect OHLC columns by their names.
data must contain all of the four series. Redundant columns are discarded.}

\item{trades}{data.frame with columns c("Start", "End", "Side", "Base", "PL").}
